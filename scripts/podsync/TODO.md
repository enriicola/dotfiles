- [ ] directly download and edit poteriforti-pagellapolitica from its rss feed, because that podcast isn't on youtube
- [ ] move official and unofficial podcasts from my pocketcasts profile to the config.json file
- [ ] scaricare e conservare in una cartella apposita i preferiti di pocketcasts e apple podcast
